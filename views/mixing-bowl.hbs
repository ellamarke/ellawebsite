                        <b>One.</b><br>
                        There is a stigma attached to receiving help from food banks, with many people
                        feeling too ashamed to go. It is estimated that only 1 in 5 of those who have trouble accessing
                        food go to food banks for help. <br><br>

                        <b>Two.</b><br>
                        Almost all food provided is tinned or long life, which means that those who rely on food
                        banks receive no fresh food, such as fruit or vegetables. <br><br>

                        <b>Three.</b><br>
                        Emergency packages are tightly rationed and are often made up of the cheapest available
                        products, leading to diets which are high in sugar, fat and salt and low on the necessary
                        vitamins and minerals. <br><br>

                        <b>Four.</b><br>
                        Many who cannot afford to buy food also do not have access to gas or electricity, so are left
                        with raw, cold food which they have no way of cooking. <br><br>

                        <b>Five.</b><br>
                        Food bank users are routinely given a collection of food products with no advice on how best
                        to cook them, so are further unable to make best use of the food they have received.

                        It is clear that the solution to this nuanced, complex problem must be nuanced itself. It must

                        Grass-roots driven: fostering an active community can help provide solutions before political
                        change is implemented.<br><br>

                        <b>Three.</b><br>
                        Political: whilst grass-roots action is crucial, policy change from government is the only
                        thing which will fundamentally change food poverty.<br><br>

                        Sustainable: for lasting effect, it must provide food education and transferable skills.<br><br>

                        <b>Five.</b><br>
                        Accessible: it must be as easy as possible to access the services or to make donations.<br><br>

                        <b>Six.</b><br>
                        Community-focused: it must foster a positive community creating a humanising, rather than
                        degrading, process.<br><br>

                        <b>Seven.</b><br>
                        Focused on joy: an opposing force to the mental distress of struggling to access food, the
                        space must function as a place where food can be a source of happiness again.
