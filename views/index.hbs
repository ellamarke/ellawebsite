                    helps to make the world a better place. I love exploring the intersections of design, society and
                    history in order to create rich, concept-focused solutions which are conscious of their context and
                    relationship with their audience.

                    I currently hold the position of Visual Designer at The University of Sheffield, but I'm still
                    available for freelance work. Iâ€™d love to hear about your project!
