                            about being able to travel again. In response, I created Voyage: a fully responsive travel

                            I wanted to create something truly research-led, so I began developing the project using a
                            combination of user research, persona creation and competitor research. I discovered that
                            whilst there are plenty of holiday and travel-centric websites out there, they are often
                            dependent on the user knowing a lot upfront: where they want to go, when they want to go and
                            how long they'll be there for. What was lacking was a place that centred the experience of
                            finding inspiration and getting deep into the culture of a new place. Voyage isn't about the
                            logistics of travel — it's about the excitement and inspiration.
