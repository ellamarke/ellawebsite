                        imagining of Orwell's 1984, inspired by the contemporary omnipresence of technology. I decided
                        to play on their use of technology in the production by using the familiar blue crash screen to
                        recreate and re-position the ominous and familiar words of Big Brother.

                        This ended up being an unused concept â€” the company decided they just wanted an illustration of
                        a CCTV camera instead. Alas.
